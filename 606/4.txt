PRACTICAL 09: ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE

Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is a collection of statistical models
and their associated estimation procedures (such as the
&quot;variation&quot; among and between groups) used to analysethe
differences among group means in a sample.
ANOVA was developed by statistician and evolutionary biologist
Ronald Fisher. In the ANOVA setting, the observed variance in a
particular variable is partitioned into components attributable
to different sources of variation. In its simplest form, ANOVA
provides a statistical test of whether the population means of
several groups are equal, and therefore generalizes the t-test to
more than two groups.
ANOVA is useful for comparing (testing) three or more group
means for statistical significance. It is conceptually similar to
multiple two-sample t-tests, but is more conservative, resulting
in fewer type I errors, and is therefore suited to a wide range of
data.
