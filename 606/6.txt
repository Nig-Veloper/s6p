#AIM: Practical of Time-series forecasting.

#THEORY:
Time-series analysis consists of set of methods used to analyze various data facts or statistics from
various characteristics of data. It is used for continuous data (e.g.: economic growth of an organization;
share prices; temperature).
Time-series components:
• Trend: It is considered behavior of a particular amount of time. It can be categorized as
increasing, decreasing, or constant trend. (e.g.: clothes)
• Seasonality: It is a pattern which repeats at the constant frequency. (e.g.: the demand for the
mangoes will be in summer season only)
• Cycle: These are type of seasonality pattern nut it doesn’t repeat at regular frequency. It cn be
generally considered as task completion time. (e.g. SDLC)

#CODE:
> data("AirPassengers") #checks if dataset “AirPassengers” is available
> class(AirPassengers) #checks type of dataset(here it is ts=timeseries)
> start(AirPassengers) #returns start of dataset
> end(AirPassengers) #returns end of dataset
> summary(AirPassengers) #to know min, max, median, 1st & 3rd quartiles

> frequency(AirPassengers)


> plot(AirPassengers)

> abline(reg=lm(AirPassengers~time(AirPassengers))) #for best-fit-line

> cycle(AirPassengers)

> boxplot(AirPassengers~cycle(AirPassengers))
