#AIM: Practical of Hypothesis testing.

#THEORY with CODE:
Hypothesis Tests, or Statistical Hypothesis Testing, is a technique used to compare two datasets, or
a sample from a dataset. It is a statistical inference method so, in the end of the test, you'll draw a
conclusion—you'll infer something — about the characteristics of what you're comparing.
A hypothesis test is usually composed by:
• Null Hypothesis (H0, read "H zero"): states that all things remain equal. No phenomena are
observed or there is not relationship between what you are comparing;
• Alternative Hypothesis (H1, read “H one”): states the opposite of the Null Hypothesis. That
there was some change, or observed relationship between what you are comparing.
Hypothesis Testing with R:
Hypothesis tests for population MEANs are done in R using the command "t.test".
