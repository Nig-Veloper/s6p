#AIM: Practical on decision tree.

#THEORY:
Decision tree analysis is a predictive modelling tool; can be applied across many areas; can be
constructed by an algorithmic approach that can split the dataset in different ways based on different
conditions; these algos falls under the category of supervised algorithms; can be used for both
classification and regression tasks; two main entities of a tree are decision nodes (where the data is
split) and leaves (where we get outcome).
About Iris dataset:
The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One
class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other.
Attribute Information:
• sepal length (in cm)
• sepal width (in cm)
• petal length (in cm)
• petal width (in cm)
• class:
-- Iris Setosa
-- Iris Versicolour
-- Iris Virginica
