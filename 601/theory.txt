1) Define and explain the following term with respect to Wireless Sensor Network.
  1. Sensor
  2. Node
  3. Base station GUI

Answer :

Sensor: In the context of wireless sensor networks (WSNs), a sensor is a device that is capable of detecting and measuring physical or environmental phenomena such as temperature, humidity, light, sound, vibration, and motion. Sensors typically have a transducer that converts the physical stimulus into an electrical signal that can be processed and transmitted by the node. They are an essential component of WSNs as they provide the data that is used for various applications such as environmental monitoring, industrial process control, and healthcare monitoring.

Node: A node in a wireless sensor network refers to a device that has the capability to sense, process, and transmit data wirelessly. A node can consist of one or more sensors, a microcontroller, a wireless communication module, and a power source. Nodes are typically deployed in large numbers to form a network that can cover a wide area and provide real-time data to a central base station. Nodes in a WSN can be stationary or mobile, depending on the application requirements.

Base station GUI: A base station graphical user interface (GUI) is a software tool used to monitor and control a wireless sensor network from a central location. It provides a visual representation of the network topology, the status of the nodes, and the data being transmitted. The GUI can be used to configure the nodes, set parameters for data collection, and analyze the collected data. It also enables the user to set alarms and alerts based on predefined thresholds, and visualize the data in various formats such as graphs, tables, and maps. The base station GUI is an essential tool for managing and maintaining large-scale wireless sensor networks.


2) What is a Sensor Node? Explain Sensor mote and Base Station [10 M]

Answer :

A sensor node is a basic building block of a wireless sensor network (WSN). It consists of a sensor, a processing unit, a communication module, and a power source. Sensor nodes are typically small, low-power devices that can be deployed in large numbers to collect data from the environment and transmit it wirelessly to a central location.

A sensor mote is a type of sensor node that is designed specifically for low-power, wireless communication. It typically consists of a microcontroller, a radio transceiver, a power source, and a sensor. Motes are often used in applications that require low-cost and low-power sensors, such as environmental monitoring, precision agriculture, and smart buildings.

A base station is a central node in a wireless sensor network that acts as a gateway for data collected by the sensor nodes. It typically consists of a more powerful processing unit, a communication module, and a larger power source than the sensor nodes. The base station is responsible for collecting and aggregating the data from the sensor nodes, and then transmitting it to a remote location or a user interface for further analysis.

The base station typically runs a graphical user interface (GUI) software that enables the user to monitor and control the network. The GUI provides a visual representation of the network topology, the status of the nodes, and the data being transmitted. It also enables the user to set alarms and alerts based on predefined thresholds, and visualize the data in various formats such as graphs, tables, and maps.

In summary, a sensor node is a device that senses and transmits data wirelessly, a sensor mote is a low-power, wireless communication sensor node, and a base station is a central node that collects and processes the data transmitted by the sensor nodes and provides a user interface for network management.


3) Discuss the working of any two mechanical sensor. [10 M]

Answer :

There are many types of mechanical sensors used to measure physical quantities such as displacement, force, pressure, and acceleration. Here, I will discuss the working of two mechanical sensors: the strain gauge and the accelerometer.

Strain Gauge:
A strain gauge is a mechanical sensor that measures the strain or deformation of a material due to an applied force. It works on the principle of piezoresistance, which is the change in electrical resistance of a material when subjected to strain. The strain gauge consists of a thin metal wire or foil, which is attached to a flexible backing material such as plastic or paper. When the material experiences a force, it deforms and stretches the gauge, causing a change in its electrical resistance. This change in resistance is measured using a Wheatstone bridge circuit and converted into an output voltage that is proportional to the applied force.

Accelerometer:
An accelerometer is a mechanical sensor that measures the acceleration of an object. It works on the principle of inertia, which is the resistance of an object to a change in its state of motion. The accelerometer consists of a mass suspended on springs or cantilevers, which is free to move in response to an acceleration. As the mass moves, it generates a force that is detected by a piezoelectric or capacitive sensor. The output of the sensor is proportional to the acceleration and can be converted into an electrical signal using a signal conditioning circuit.

In summary, the strain gauge measures the deformation of a material due to an applied force, while the accelerometer measures the acceleration of an object. Both sensors work by converting a physical quantity into an electrical signal that can be measured and analyzed.



4) What What is MANET? How it works? Explain with the help of an example


Answer :

MANET stands for Mobile Ad hoc Network, which is a type of wireless network in which mobile devices communicate with each other without the need for a fixed infrastructure such as access points or base stations. In a MANET, each device can act as a node, and they can communicate directly with each other or through other intermediate nodes.

In a MANET, the nodes are responsible for routing and forwarding the data packets. They use a routing protocol to discover and maintain the routes between the nodes. The nodes exchange control packets, such as hello messages and route discovery messages, to build and update their routing tables. The routing protocol can be either proactive, reactive or hybrid depending on the network requirements.

Let's take an example to understand how a MANET works. Suppose there is a group of hikers who are on a trekking trip in a remote area. They have smartphones and other mobile devices with them, and they want to communicate with each other to coordinate their activities and share information. However, there is no cellular network coverage or any other infrastructure available in the area.

In this scenario, the hikers can form a MANET by enabling the Wi-Fi hotspot feature on their smartphones and connecting their devices to the hotspot. This creates a wireless network in which each device acts as a node. The nodes can communicate with each other directly or through intermediate nodes using the ad hoc routing protocol.

Suppose one hiker wants to send a message to another hiker who is not in the direct communication range. The message will be relayed through intermediate nodes until it reaches the destination. The routing protocol will ensure that the message is forwarded through the most efficient path by considering factors such as the available bandwidth, signal strength, and distance.

In summary, a MANET is a type of wireless network in which mobile devices communicate with each other without the need for a fixed infrastructure. It works by enabling each device to act as a node and using a routing protocol to discover and maintain the routes between the nodes. A MANET can be used in various applications such as disaster response, military operations, and outdoor activities.



5) Define and explain the following term with respect to TinyOS [10 M]
  1. Events
  2. Commands
  
Answer :

TinyOS is an operating system designed for wireless sensor networks, which provides a flexible and efficient platform for developing and deploying sensor applications. In TinyOS, there are two important concepts, events and commands.

Events:
Events are used to signal the occurrence of an activity or a change in the system state. An event can be triggered by a sensor reading, a timer, or an external stimulus. When an event occurs, TinyOS generates an interrupt and invokes the corresponding event handler function, which can perform some specific task or trigger other events. For example, when a temperature sensor reading exceeds a threshold, it can generate a temperature event, which can be used to trigger an action, such as turning on a cooling fan or sending a notification to a remote server.

Commands:
Commands are used to initiate an action or request a service from a component or module in the system. A command can be sent from one module to another to trigger some action or retrieve some information. When a command is received, the target module executes the corresponding command handler function, which performs the requested action or returns the requested information. For example, a command can be sent to a radio module to transmit a message or to a sensor module to read a value.

In summary, events and commands are two fundamental concepts in TinyOS. Events are used to signal the occurrence of an activity or a change in the system state, while commands are used to initiate an action or request a service from a module in the system. These concepts provide a flexible and efficient framework for developing sensor applications in TinyOS.




6) What are directional antenna? How does it work? Explain with the help of an example.

Answer :

A directional antenna is a type of antenna that radiates or receives electromagnetic waves preferentially in a certain direction. It is designed to focus its radiation pattern in a particular direction, while suppressing radiation in other directions. The directionality of a directional antenna is determined by its physical shape and the way it is designed.

A directional antenna works by concentrating the radiated energy in a particular direction, while minimizing the radiation in other directions. This is achieved by shaping the antenna in such a way that the radiation is concentrated in a certain area or angle. A directional antenna can be compared to a flashlight, where the beam of light is focused in a certain direction, while the rest of the area remains dark.

One common example of a directional antenna is the Yagi-Uda antenna, which is widely used in television and radio broadcasting. The Yagi-Uda antenna consists of a driven element, a reflector, and several directors. The driven element is the active part of the antenna that converts the electrical signal into electromagnetic waves. The reflector is a metallic plate behind the driven element that reflects the waves and increases the gain of the antenna. The directors are metallic rods in front of the driven element that focus the radiation in a particular direction.

Another example of a directional antenna is the parabolic reflector antenna, which is commonly used in satellite communication and long-distance wireless links. The parabolic reflector antenna consists of a curved reflector surface that reflects the incoming waves to a focal point, where a small antenna is placed. The curved surface of the reflector is designed to reflect the waves in a certain direction, while minimizing the radiation in other directions.

In summary, a directional antenna is a type of antenna that radiates or receives electromagnetic waves preferentially in a certain direction. It works by focusing the radiation in a particular area or angle, while suppressing the radiation in other directions. Directional antennas have many practical applications in various fields such as broadcasting, communication, and surveillance.



7) What is a routing table? How does it Route the packets which comes to router 

Answer : 

A routing table is a data structure used by a router to determine the next hop or the path that a packet should take to reach its destination. The routing table contains a list of available network destinations and the next hop or gateway to reach each destination. It is typically maintained by the router's routing protocol, which exchanges routing information with other routers in the network.

When a packet arrives at a router, the router looks up the destination IP address of the packet in its routing table to determine the next hop or the outgoing interface that the packet should be forwarded to. The router selects the best path based on the routing protocol and the metrics associated with each path, such as hop count, bandwidth, delay, or cost.

If the router cannot find a matching entry in its routing table for the destination IP address, it will drop the packet or forward it to a default gateway or a special routing table called the "default route" if one is configured. The default gateway is typically used as a last resort when no specific route exists in the routing table for the destination network.

Routing tables are dynamic and can change over time as the network topology changes or the routing protocol exchanges new information with other routers. Routing algorithms and protocols are designed to ensure that the routing table is updated with the most current information, and that packets are routed along the best path to their destination.

In summary, a routing table is a data structure used by a router to determine the next hop or the path that a packet should take to reach its destination. The router looks up the destination IP address of the packet in its routing table and selects the best path based on the routing protocol and the metrics associated with each path. The routing table is dynamic and can change over time as the network topology changes or the routing protocol exchanges new information with other routers.
