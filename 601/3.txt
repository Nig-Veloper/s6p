#AIM: Create MAC protocol simulation implementation for wireless sensor Network.
#STEPS:
Consider the following topology :

Adding the wireless interface to each Laptops

Copy the MAC address of each component as follows

We note the following MAC addresses and convert them to the following form
COMPONENT MAC Address Converted MAC Address
Laptop0 0002.160E.40CE 00:02:16:0E:40:CE
Laptop1 000B.BEBB.5590 00:0B:BE:BB:55:90
Laptop2 0060.70D0.BCDB 00:60:70:D0:BC:DB
TabletPC0 0040.0B38.4B8B 00:40:0B:38:4B:8B
Smartphone1 0001.97D2.1052 00:40:0B:38:4B:8B
Smartphone0 0001.647A.027C 00:01:64:7A:02:7C

Now we add few addresses in the wireless MAC filter of the Wireless Router and
then use the given options for either allow or deny the Wireless access

As seen in above screen shot we add the MAC address of Laptop0, TabletPC
SmartPhone0 in the list so as to deny them accessing the Wireless network and
then save the settings

The result so obtained is as shown, the three devices denied any wireless
connectivity

Similarly we can change the setting so that the above devices get wireless
connectivity and the remaining devices do not get the wireless connectivity

And save the setting and get the following
