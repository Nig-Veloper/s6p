Aim: Study Cloud Security management
Cloud computing security is the set of control-based technologies and policies designed to adhere to
regulatory compliance rules and protect information, data applications and infrastructure associated
with cloud computing use. Because of the cloud's very nature as a shared resource, identity
management, privacy and access control are of particular concern. With more organizations using cloud
computing and associated cloud providers for data operations, proper security in these and other
potentially vulnerable areas have become a priority for organizations contracting with a cloud
computing provider.
Security Management
Procedure:
Write all the steps of account creation, admin rights and userâ€™s creation finally generate
credentials.csv and security management using MFA (By link AWS account with Google Authenticator on
Mobile device)
Conclusion:
We have studied how to secure the cloud and its data. Amazon EWS provides the best security
with its extended facilities and services like MFA device. It also gives you the ability to add your
own permissions and policies for securing data more encrypted
